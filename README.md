## Problem description

The problem to resolve consists of programming the game named "Othello" and the "Min-Max (with depth)" algorithm.

The objective of programing these programs is to create a AI which plays Othello against another player. Both players playing the game must have the option to be a user or to be the AI programmed with the "Min-Max" algorithm.
 
After Othello is working correctly and the AI working correctly and is able to play Othello as a player, we have to do the following experiments and modifications:
-  Calculate the average time the AI takes to make its move.
-  Make sure the AI is making a move in less than 10 seconds.

That is basicly the description of the problem and objectives.

The specific requirements are the following:

- The program reports the computer(AI) response time after each turn.
- The program reports the average response time of the computer at the end of the game.
- The program reports the number of black and white tiles that exist on the board at the end of the game, determining a winner.
- The program has an initial menu where you can choose to be black or white.
- The program shows the current state of the board after each turn.
- MinMaxWithDepthest algorithm has been successfully implemented.
- The α β prunning algorithm is properly integrated into the MinMaxWithDepth algorithm as seen in classes.
- Othello is working correctly and accordingly to the official game rules.


## Heuristic functions

We defined a variety of heuristic functions to be used in our Min-Max algorithm for the "Eval()" function.

The heuristic functions we defined are :

### Highest score heuristic

This strategy consists in returning the number of tokens on board to determine who has the upperhand.


### Best flank heuristic

This best flank heuristic consists of making a move which flanks more enemy tokens.

For Example:

If we reach a "Cut off" state and we have a move #1 which flanks 2 enemy tokens and a move #2 which flanks 4 enemy tokens, the next move will be the move #2 because it has a bigger number of flanks done.

### Movility strategy heuristic

Consists in returning the number of possible moves to determine de upperhand.
The player who has more moves at the start of the game around 20 turns, has a higher chance to force the oponent to make
bad moves in the late game.

When we are in the late game the heuristic changes to the highest score heuristic

The heuristics can be changed in the Settings class. (setting the heuristic methods defined in the heuristicFunctions class)


## Results

### Average decition making time from the AI

The average time the AI takes to make a move is:  between 6 and 11 seconds


## Conclusions

We have observed that the heuristic is very important.

We observed that the highest score strategy is more consistent in terms of the average time the computer takes to respond.

We observed that the movility strategy is sometimes better, but there are cases where it takes up to 40 seconds to respond. But at the end it returns a very low average response time around 6 seconds.
